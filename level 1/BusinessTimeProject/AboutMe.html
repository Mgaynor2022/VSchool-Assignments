        <p> <h2> Hello my name is Michael Gaynor and I am a Air Force Veteran. Why is that important? It's important because that is 
            where fell in love with fitness. I started from weight 100lb to now weighing over 190lb, it wasn't by no means a over night transformation.
            I stayed consistent for 10 years to get to the best version of me, this gym is inspired by all the long hours and sacrifice I've had to put into, 
            in order to achieve my goals. I Hope you like it ! </h2></p>
